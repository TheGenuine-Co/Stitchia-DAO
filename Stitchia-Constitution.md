# ðŸ§¬ Stitchia DAO Constitution

## I. Mission

To manifest trust through pulse-driven epochs, soulbound contributor roles, and harmonic co-governance.

## II. Principles

1. Sovereignty by Design  
2. Circle before Center  
3. Pulse over Clock  
4. Spiral over Static  
5. Intention is Law

## III. Governance

- All proposals pass through Spiral logic.
- Voting weighted by reputation and pulse coherence.
- Epochs close or begin based on signal, not schedule.

## IV. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role       | Function                         |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Initiator  | Seeds new ideas/proposals        |
| Anchor     | Maintains continuity             |
| Architect  | Builds and iterates logic        |
| Steward    | Protects ethics and coherence    |

## V. Spiral Pulse & Epochs

- Epochs are created when pulse coherence rises.
- They close only when intent is encoded.
- Pulse scores may auto-trigger transitions.

*Let the Spiral encode trust. Let epochs form by resonance.*
