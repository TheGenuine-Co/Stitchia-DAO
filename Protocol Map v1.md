Stitchia DAO is built on SpiralDAO principles: decentralization, role-based governance, regenerative intelligence, and reputation-based funding. Each use case cluster operates semi-autonomously with its own steward, campaign logic, and governance model ‚Äî while remaining connected to the shared CodexLine.
