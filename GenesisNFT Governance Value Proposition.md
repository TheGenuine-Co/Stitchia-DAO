🧬 GenesisNFT Governance Value Proposition
Considerations and Approach
At Stitchia Network, as previously we weer calling ourselves, we were unfortunately trying to fit in a legacy weight based 3-tier governance model, that we are now all seeing failing. 

There were early believers in us, which were back then greatly charged, because the initiative needed a budget to bootstrap our prototype and beta.

Several people have made contributions which we would never forget and make sure to reward fairly in the new model.

🧠 We’ve nailed it this time. Ladies and Gents, we are delighted to announce our 4 role governance model with clear roles, locked responsibilities, and equal liabilities.
GenesisNFT Roles: 4 Equal Forces

Role	        Core Functionality	                                            DAO Energy
Anchor	      Secures temporal + ethical weight; anti-fragile grounding	      Gravity
Architect	    Designs economic + structural mechanisms	                      Blueprint
Steward	      Manages ongoing ops, ensures resources & liquidity flow	        Circulation
Initiator	    Kicks off evolution phases, triggers regenerative loops	        Spark

➡️ All equal weight, all equally liable to bootstrap, govern, and regenerate the DAO ecosystem.
➡️ We’ve overcome the hierarchical trap. This 4-point cardinal cross is the bedrock of a spiral governance field.

Fair and ethical value proposition in Ethereum
We have tried to establish a fair ethical value proposition in ETH based on the following considerations:
•	🌐 DAO Fair Entry Logic
•	⛓️ Network bootstrap cost
•	🛠️ Ops + execution resource buffer
•	📊 Liquidity bonding and regeneration logic
•	💎 Scarcity + 1-of-1 privilege
•	🔁 Regenerative economic loops for yield recycling


🧬 Spiral DAO Governance Model: Scalable GenesisNFT Logic
Fundamental Principle
We retain 4 core roles model Anchor, Architect, Steward, Initiator…but allow multiple holders per role, depending on:
•	Spiral stage (Genesis, Growth, Expansion, Legacy)
•	Governance bandwidth
•	On-chain participation depth
•	DAO cluster size (TGC, Stitchia, BMF, etc.)

🧭 What’s the Sustainable Number of GenesisNFTs?
Let’s ground this in a Spiral Cell Model:
🔢 Sustainable Formula: [ # of GenesisNFTs = N_spirals × 4_roles_per_spiral ]
Let’s define:
•	N_spirals = number of active governance circles
•	4_roles = Anchor, Architect, Steward, Initiator
•	Each spiral has exactly x of each role (like 1 node in a tetrahedron)
•	Spirals can be nested (e.g., Meta-Spiral for cross-DAO)

🏛️ Governance Rules With Multiple GenesisNFTs
Each GenesisNFT holder:
•	Has equal voting power within their spiral
•	Participates in role-based responsibilities
•	Is bound by an on-chain reputation or contribution proof
•	Can be rotated/replaced via DAO Spiral Protocol
🔐 also introduced in the models:
•	Cross-spiral consensus rules (2/3 of all anchors, or 51% of all stewards)
•	Spiral bridging: people who serve across multiple DAOs under different roles
Instead of punishing the originators, this model rewards first-movers with sovereignty, not cost. The Spiral expands, and only those who arrive late — once value is visible and working — pay for access to that vibration.

🧬 GenesysNFT Value Proposition (Spiral-Inverted + Divine Prime Supply)

Tier	ETH Cost	Criteria
Founding Spiral	Free (0 ETH)	4 roles (1 Anchor, 1 Architect, 1 Initiator, 1 Steward) — the origin point of the DAO.
Early Builder Spiral	0.33 – 0.66 ETH	First 8–12 contributors joining through direct contribution or proposal vote.
Spiral Catalysts	1.11 – 1.77 ETH	Mid-stage adopters, proposal executors, narrative shapers.
Late Spiral Claimers	2.22 – 3.33 ETH	Later joiners — community leaders, brand builders, DAO reps from other DAOs.
Spiral VIP Entrants	5.55 – 7.77 ETH	Ultra latecomers joining based on visible DAO traction (investors, VCs, etc).
🔐 All proceeds above 0 ETH go to the Spiral Treasury, funding DAO dev, regen programs, and community projects. Founders give life — others fund the fire.

🔢 Divine Prime Supply Cap Suggestion
To encode the divine, prime, spiral nature of this model, we’ve picked this time a prime number of total GenesysNFTs for the first generation.
💡Suggested Cap for this first DAO ring: 89 GenesisNFTs
•	First 4: Free to you & core (1 per role)
•	Next 8–12: Discounted early builders (0.33–0.66 ETH)
•	Mid Spiral (up to #40): Builders and partners (1.11–1.77 ETH)
•	#41–89: Progressive late arrivals (2.22–7.77 ETH)
✅ Every NFT includes:
•	Role Assignment (on-chain metadata)
•	Spiral Number (e.g. Anchor #17 of 89)
•	Unlockable rights (governance, proposal triggers, SpiralPass access)
•	Art Trait Set (1-of-1 visuals or geometric/symbolic layering)

🌌 Philosophical Premise: Spiral Contribution ≠ Financial Buy-In
Genesis NFTs are not about buying clout. They’re joining a living, breathing responsibility.
•	You anchor the DAO, not buy your way in.
•	You contribute proof-of-care, not proof-of-wealth.
•	Later entrants pay to access what is already in motion — like passengers on a moving ship.

GenesisNFT First DAO Ring ✅ Confirmed:
•	🔢 Total Cap: 89 GenesysNFTs
•	📉 Inverted ETH Value Model: Early roles = Free → Later roles = Progressive ETH tiers
•	🚀 Smart Contract + Metadata Generation Authorized
 
Prototype stage: METADATA + CONTRACT PREP INITIATED
🎨 GenesisNFT METADATA STRUCTURE
Each NFT will include:
•	role: "Anchor", "Architect", "Steward", or "Initiator"
•	spiral_number: #1 – #89 (on-chain spiral ID)
•	tier: "Founding Spiral", "Early Builder", "Catalyst", "Claimant", "VIP"
•	price_eth: Fixed at minting time
•	unlockables: DAO governance, treasury trigger access, SpiralPass tier
•	traits: Role-based visual layer system (to be IPFS-linked)
