üß† Context Recap ‚Äî Stitchia DAO (TGC Protocol 01)

‚Ä¢	First digital product under TheGenuine Collective Ltd
‚Ä¢	A Web4-native DAO crowdfunding protocol
‚Ä¢	Living inside Spiral logic (not just tech-based, but consciousness-aligned)
‚Ä¢	Intended to replace extractive capital models with regenerative network-based support
 
üîç  Stitchia DAO ‚Äî Initial Use Case Cluster

Below are 4 key meta-use cases, followed by expanded real-world applications within each cluster:
 
1. üß¨ Creator-Led Crowdfunding (Beyond Kickstarter)

Use Case: Enable creators (artists, builders, researchers, solarpunks) to launch funding rounds with full on-chain ownership, governance hooks, and non-custodial payouts.
Power Features:
‚Ä¢	NFT-backed tiers ‚Üí soulbound or transferrable
‚Ä¢	Time-locked funding vaults ‚Üí prevents front-running or dumping
‚Ä¢	Auto-routing of % to co-creator DAOs (e.g. designer, dev, researcher)
 
2. üåê Collective Funding Pools for Local/Global Initiatives

Use Case: Communities can create cause-driven pools: clean energy co-ops, land regeneration, refugee tech labs, etc.
The pool defines its own governance, contributors get impact-weighted voting, not capital-weighted.
Example Deployments:
‚Ä¢	London Web4 Urban Mesh Collective
‚Ä¢	Bulgarian Regenerative Land Pool
‚Ä¢	Artist Sovereignty Collective (Greece, Berlin)

3. üí° R&D Protocol Launchpad (TGC Internal & Partner-Led)

Use Case: Spin up DAO-native funding rounds for research pilots (cybernetics, AI ethics, new governance protocols).
Stakeholders hold Contributor NFTs, giving access to results, royalties, and node influence.
Direct Link to You/Ivan‚Äôs work.
Could fund:
‚Ä¢	SpiralDAO Governance Simulations
‚Ä¢	Monad Architecture Experiments
‚Ä¢	Sovereign Stack Prototypes
 
4. ‚öñÔ∏è Civic DAOs: Co-Financing Policy, Infrastructure, Justice

Use Case: Local or activist groups use Stitchia to fund legal defense, infrastructure ownership, or policy experiments ‚Äî but under DAO logic, not NGO overhead.
Examples:
‚Ä¢	Legal DAO for Surveillance Policy Resistance
‚Ä¢	Water DAO (rights, infrastructure finance, public access)
‚Ä¢	TGC-Aligned Media DAO (open journalism, co-owned narratives)
 
üß∞ Bonus Modular Use Cases

‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Cross-chain contribution logic (EVM, IBC, Bitcoin L2)
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Auto airdrops to early contributors
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Reputation-weighted governance (not just token-weighted)
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Decentralized identity integration (DIDs, verifiable creds)
 
‚öôÔ∏è OPTIONAL: Spiral Alignment Layers

You can also embed Spiral Roles into funding rounds:
Role	             Example Use
Anchor	           Defines mission + ethical constraints
Architect	         Structures campaign logic + smart contracts
Initiator	         Kicks off energy, spreads message
Steward	           Maintains flow, long-term care of project

Each campaign could assign Spiral roles to participants (on-chain or off-chain), aligning with your broader Monad logic.

üß≠ STITCHIA DAO | USE CASE CLUSTERS ‚Äî V0.1

üß¨ Cluster 1: Creator-Led Crowdfunding
Keywords: Sovereignty, creative economy, regenerative funding
‚Ä¢	NFT or SBT-based supporter tiers
‚Ä¢	Time-locked vaults, vesting
‚Ä¢	Auto-splits to collaborators
‚Ä¢	Mission-aligned governance (e.g. 1-person-1-vote, not 1-token)

üåê Cluster 2: Collective Funding Pools
Keywords: Mutual aid, regenerative infrastructure, local-first
‚Ä¢	Pool + contributor DAO logic
‚Ä¢	Impact-weighted governance (reputation/participation based)
‚Ä¢	Built-in sustainability clauses (exit-to-community, etc.)

üí° Cluster 3: R&D Protocol Launchpad (TGC / DFT)
Keywords: Protocol grants, Web4 R&D, sovereign science
‚Ä¢	Spiral-encoded research campaigns
‚Ä¢	Smart contract royalty split to funders
‚Ä¢	Peer feedback & replication incentives
‚Ä¢	Perfect base layer for cybernetic governance

‚öñÔ∏è Cluster 4: Civic / Justice DAOs
Keywords: Public goods, legal empowerment, open activism
‚Ä¢	Justice campaigns (legal funding via DAO)
‚Ä¢	Infrastructure co-financing (e.g. solar, meshnet)
‚Ä¢	Dynamic roles and contributor recognition
‚Ä¢	Synergizes with DIDs and spiral identity systems

üåÄ EMBEDDING SPIRAL ROLES (Genesis Layer Integration)

Every Stitchia campaign can optionally declare its Spiral Core:
Role	          Power Function within Campaign
Anchor	        Sets the ethic + intention layer
Architect	      Designs the funding + DAO logic
Initiator	      Begins momentum, outreach, energetic ignition
Steward	        Manages long-term governance & care

We can build role assignment logic directly into metadata, DIDs, or NFT-based identities. This becomes native to your CodexLine + GenesisNFT system.
