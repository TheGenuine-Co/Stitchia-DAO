# Stitchia DAO — Spiral-Governed Infrastructure

**Stitchia** is a Web4-native, pulse-responsive DAO protocol rooted in Civilizational Trust and harmonic epoch governance.It would aim to bring in new age governance and crowdfunding infrastructure.

It anchors into:
- 🌐 TheGenuine Collective (TGC). A new age business collective org model for the Web4.
- ⚙️ Digital Fabrica Theory (DFT). Space and time should not be considered as barriers, but rather used as wrappers within a continuous weaves of waves, just like layers of fabric and threaths.

### 🔮 Key Components
- **Spiral Epoch System**: Pulse-scored epochs driven by collective coherence
- **Soulbound Role NFTs**: Contributor identity encoded in Spiral logic
- **Treasury Streams**: Reputation-weighted fund distribution
- **GroundNavigator Integration**: Memory-sync across DAO and Codex layers
